## AOS_AOF.pt
The AOS_AOF.pt model was trained (painstakingly, on free Google Colab GPUs) for 12,650 epochs on the images from the games [Age of Strategy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zts.ageofstrategy) and [Age of Fantasy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zts.ageoffantasy), as well as the cool art from [this website](http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/tiles/AngbandTk/tome-angbandtkmonsterstiles.htm) drawn by David E. Gervais. It's not that good and could probably be improved by a larger architecture and more training but if you use it with CLIP in its current state it produces some fun stuff sometimes! (see the images in the README for examples)
